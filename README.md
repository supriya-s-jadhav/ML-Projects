# ML (Machine Learning) Projects

This repository is the collection of different test cases and demonstrating solutions by implementing different algorithms and statistical models. The programming language used in demonstrating the test cases will be Python or R.

# What is Machine Learning ?

[source: Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)

Machine learning (ML) is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead. It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task.

# Classifying Machine LEarning Problems:

## 1. Classification

Classification problems involves predicting whether the observations in given dataset belongs to categories. For example predicting the possibility of cancer in humans can have only two outcomes: Yes/No, is a binary class classification.

Classification predictive modeling is the task of approximating a mapping function (f) from input variables (X) to discrete output variables (y). The output variables are often called labels or categories. The mapping function predicts the class or category for a given observation.

Key:

1) Predictor variable/independent variable is categorical or qualitative.

2) Classes to which output may belong are known. A problem with two classes are called binary classification and problem with more than two classes are called multi-class classification problem.

Examples:

1) Medical diagnosis

2) Credit card industry to predict loan defaulters.

## 2. Regression

Regression problems involves predicting a fixed value like sales of an organization etc. Regression predictive modeling is the task of approximating a mapping function (f) from input variables (X) to a continuous output variable (y). A continuous output variable is a real-value, such as an integer or floating point value. These are often quantities, such as amounts and sizes.

A problem with multiple input variables is often called a multivariate regression problem. A regression problem where input variables are ordered by time is called a time series forecasting problem.

Key:

1) Response variable is always quantitative.

2) We will need historical data with all input-output observations.

Examples:

1) Predicting the selling cost of a house.

2) Predicting monthly/yearly sales of an organization.

## 3. Clustering

Clustering is the grouping of data points based on similarity and dissimilarity within the observations in a dataset.

Key:

1. Clustering involves unlabeled data.

2. Similar features within clusters and dissimilar features between clusters.

Examples:

1. It can be used to characterize & discover customer segments for marketing purposes.

2. It can be used for classification among different species of plants and animals based on their characteristics.


# Known issues

1. Sometimes github fails to render the jupyter notebooks (.ipynb extension). You will the below message when viewing the .ipynb files on a GitHub blob page.

```
Sorry, something went wrong. Reload?
```

Its an issue on github side. Possible solutions are:
1. Wait until the .ipynb files loads, it might take from few days to weeks.
2. Open [nbviewer]("https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/") and paste the link to your notebook.
